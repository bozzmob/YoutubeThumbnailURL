This script fetches the thumbnail of any YouTube user. This was done as an internal project of mine to fecilitate some automated operation.

To Use this script, type-

./getThumbnailURL.sh #YouTubeUserName#

Example-
./getThumbnailURL.sh ESPN

You can execute the same multiple times for different values. The output can be seen in the output.txt file.
